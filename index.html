		<h2>Tuca's personality</h2>
		<p>Tuca is a confident, exuberant, bouncy, wild, and friendly Tucan woman who seems to have a free-spirited approach to life. This approach seems to fill up the void that she has in her life due to her broken family and fears. However, she is not afraid to speak her mind when the line is crossed.<br>Despite her flaws, she does know that she always has her best friends, Bertie and Speckleâ€”as her honorary family. She does try to improve herself as a person, even giving up alcohol and sex, to become more responsible.</p>
